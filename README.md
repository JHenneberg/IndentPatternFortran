# IndentPatternFortran
General indentation patterns for Fortran.

There are some IDEs in which Fortran is programmed (VS Code, Atom, Code::Blocks...), which allow to insert Fortran source code via extensions or directly. However, the basic procedure remains the same. A pattern is recognized via RegEx and indented further or less. This repository is abstract and only provides a collection of RegEx commands, which can be used further.
